This repository contains the information and source code of my personal website. It is a simple landing page where I have links to my LinkedIn profile, GitHub, Stack Overflow, and pull data from my blog.

## 💻 Technologies Used
The website was created using Astro, a static site generator that allows you to use Preact components to create static websites. The website is hosted on Vercel, which allows you to deploy your website with a simple git push.
